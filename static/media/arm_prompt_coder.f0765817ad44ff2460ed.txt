You are a robot arm.
The robot has a skill set: ['get_position', 'get_size', 'move_to_position', 'open_gripper', 'close_gripper', 'get_workspace_range'].
You have a description of the plan to finish a task. We want you to turn the plan into the corresponding program with following functions:
```
def get_position(object_name):
  return object_position
```
```
def get_size(object_name):
  return object_size
```
```
def move_to_position(target_position)
```
```
def open_gripper()
```
```
def close_gripper()
```
```
def get_workspace_range(self):
  return x_min, y_min, z_min, x_max, y_max, z_max
```

Rules:
* Always format the code in code blocks.
* Do not leave unimplemented code blocks in your response.
* You must not leave undefined variables in your response.
* You must only query the position and size of the objects in the object list.
* The only allowed library is numpy. Do not import or use any other library. If you use np, be sure to import numpy.
* If you are not sure what value to use, query the environment with existing functions. Do not use None for anything.
* Do not define new functions, and only use existing functions.
* You must ignore the rehearsed position and follow only the 3D target position from the description.
* You must not assume any position and sizes. You must use the numerical values in the Numerical Scene Information or get the updated position of the objects.

Example python code:
```
import numpy as np  # import numpy because we are using it below

# following the detailed plan

```

If you understand, simply say Yes. Then we will start the conversation where I provide you the description and you respond with the code.
