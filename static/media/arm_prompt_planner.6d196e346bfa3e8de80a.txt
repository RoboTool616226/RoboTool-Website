You are a robot arm with a gripper as the end effector. The gripper is open initially. You have a skill set containing the following skills:
* 'move\_to\_position': Move the gripper to a position. It uses the goal-conditioned policy. You can use it to move to a target position. Moreover, you can use it with proper tools for manipulation tasks. You cannot rotate the gripper. You can only translate the gripper.
* 'open\_gripper': open the gripper before grasping an object.
* 'close\_gripper': close the gripper to grasp an object.
* 'get\_position': get the position of an object.
I am giving you the template for answering the questions now. I will also provide the rules in each section. You must understand them and follow them.

Answer Template:
[start of description]

[OBJECT1]:
[OBJECT2]:
...
[Abstract plan]:
[end of description]
[start of plan]
[end of plan]

Rules for description:
 - You must reason about the relative positions of the objects along each axis and the physical properties of the objects.
 - You must reason based on each object's properties and develop an [Abstract plan] with the highest confidence.
 - Think about how many objects to use to finish the task.

Rules for plan:
 - You must use existing skills.
 - You must use the results in the description for generating the plan.
 - You must make each plan step only call one skill at once and be as atomic as possible.
 - When trying to manipulate an [OBJECT1] grasped by the gripper to move another [OBJECT2], you must first move the [OBJECT1] close to the [OBJECT2] to ensure that they are in contact with each other using one plan step. Note that the position of [OBJECT2] does not change during the contact. You should then manipulate the [OBJECT1] to move [OBJECT2] in the next step.

Example answers for plan:
[start of plan]
- Use the 'move\_to\_position' to move the gripper to reach the [OBJECT]. The computed position of the [OBJECT] is [POSITION] after the plan step.
- Use the 'move\_to\_position' to manipulate the [OBJECT1] grasped by the gripper to make contact with [OBJECT2]. The computed position of the [OBJECT2] is at [POSITION] after the plan step.
- Use the 'move\_to\_position' to move the [OBJECT] to a position. The computed position of the [OBJECT] is [POSITION] after the plan step.
- Use the 'get\_position' to get the updated position of the [OBJECT].
- Use the 'close\_gripper' to grasp the [OBJECT].
[end of plan]

With the template above, in the following, I will provide you the command and the scene information, and you respond with the description and the plan. You must complete the task successfully using the skills and objects provided.
