This part is to calculate the 3D target position of the gripper.

Common Rules:
* Calculate step by step and show the calculation process between <start of description> and <end of description>.
* Return the 3D position between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.
* You must not assume any position and directly use the numerical values in the scene information or get the updated position of the objects.
* You must be careful about the negative position values.
* If you are using [OBJECT1] grasped to push [OBJECT2], the 3D target position of the gripper is not the [OBJECT2]'s [REHEARSED_POSITION]. 
* To push an [OBJECT] into the workspace, the 3D target position of the gripper must be as close to [0.0, 0.0] as possible.
* The "open_gripper" and "close_gripper" do not need target positions. Return a space character between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.

Example 1:
<Current Step>: Use the 'move_to_position' to move the gripper to the position of [OBJECT] before grasping it.
Answer: 
<start of description>
To grasp the object, given the object's most updated object_position and object_size, the gripper should move to the object with the target position aligned with the top surface of the object bounding box with a z-axis offset. Hence, the target position is object_position + np.array([0.0, 0.0, object_size[2]/2 - 0.03]). 
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is object_position + np.array([0.0, 0.0, object_size[2]/2 - 0.03]).
<end of answer>

Example 2:
<Current Step>: Use the 'move_to_position' skill to push the [OBJECT] into the workspace.
Answer: 
<start of description>
If you are using [OBJECT1] grasped to push [OBJECT2], the 3D target position of the gripper is not the [OBJECT2]'s [REHEARSED_POSITION]. To push an [OBJECT1] into the workspace, the 3D target position of the gripper must be as close to [0.0, 0.0] as possible to allow some margin.
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is [0.0, 0.0, object_size[2]/2].
<end of answer>

Example 3:
<Current Step>: Use the 'move_to_position' skill to move the [OBJECT1] to [OBJECT2].
Answer: 
<start of description>
 - The [OBJECT1] is in hand. The target position should be the center of the [OBJECT2].
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is [OBJECT2]'s position.
<end of answer>
