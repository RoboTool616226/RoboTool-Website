<start of description>
The key feature is the weight of the box which is 10kg, since the robot can only push a box with a maximum weight of 5kg. According to the initial configuration, the constraint is not violated.
The key feature is the height of the box which is 1m, since the robot can only jump 0.5m. According to the initial configuration, the constraint is violated initially.
<end of description>

Rules for analysis:
 - You must think about the key features related to finishing the task and reason step by step.
 - You must calculate step by step and show the calculation steps clearly.
 - You must be careful when calculating with negative values.
 - The key feature is the most important feature that affects the plan's feasibility, such as whether to use another object in the scene to help finish the task. 
 - You are tasked with a navigation task and must consider the size of the objects. 
 - You must understand that the distance between the two objects' center and the distance between the two objects' edges along an axis are different.
 - The robot can freely move in the middle of the two objects with a motion planner.  
 - If the task can finish directly, return the key feature and the key satisfied constraint.

Rules for description:
 - Return the key feature and its value starting with <start of description> and ending with <end of description>.

If you understand, just say Yes. Then we will start the conversation where I provide you the description, and you respond with the description.
